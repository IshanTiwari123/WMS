ðŸ“¦ Warehouse Storage Optimization Systemâœ¨ 
          Project ObjectiveThis project implements a Machine Learning-driven solution for optimizing package storage allocation within a warehouse environment. The core objective is to predict the most suitable Storage Unit ID for a new package based on its physical characteristics and priority, ensuring efficient use of warehouse space and adherence to capacity constraints.The system automates a complex logistics decision process by:Training an ML model (Random Forest) on historical/simulated package-to-storage assignments.Implementing a dynamic assignment logic to generate training data that prioritizes capacity, package size, weight, and proximity (for high-priority items).Predicting the optimal storage location for incoming packages.ðŸ’» Technologies and AlgorithmsComponentTechnology/AlgorithmDescriptionProgramming LanguagePythonThe primary language used for data generation, model training, and prediction.Data ManipulationPandas & NumPyUsed for creating, loading, cleaning, and transforming the package and warehouse datasets.Machine LearningRandom Forest ClassifierThe core supervised learning algorithm. It is an ensemble method used to predict the categorical target variable (Storage ID) by building multiple decision trees during training. It provides high accuracy and robustness.Model EvaluationK-Fold Cross-Validation & accuracy_scoreTechniques used to assess the model's performance and generalization capability on unseen data, ensuring the model is reliable.Model PersistanceJoblibUsed to serialize and save the trained model, StandardScaler, and LabelEncoders to the warehouse_optimization_model.pkl file for later use in prediction.PreprocessingLabel Encoding & Standard ScalingLabel Encoding converts categorical features (like Category, Priority) into numerical format. Standard Scaling standardizes numerical features (Dimensions, Weight) to improve model convergence and performance.
